Hi, I'm Marcus 👋🏻 I'm a student of computer science interested in compilers, Swift, Lean and whatever strikes my fancy.  
I sometimes come across topics which aren't well documented and require a good deal of work to figure out. Those are the topics I plan on writing about - hoping that it might make the path easier for others.

If there's a project associated with a post, you can probably find it on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/marcusrossel).

I have little knowledge of web-development, so if you have any suggestions on how to improve this website feel free to create an issue or make a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcusrossel/marcusrossel.github.io).

Thanks for reading!
