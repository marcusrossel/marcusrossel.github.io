title: "Bachelor's Thesis: Provable Determinism in Reactors"
---

As of yesterday, I've completed my bachelor's degree in computer science at TU Dresden.
The topic of my thesis was *Provable Determinism in Reactors*, in which I formalize a simplified version of a mathematical model of computation called *Reactors*, and prove that it is deterministic. For this I used an awesome tool for formalizing mathematics, called [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io). I've uploaded my thesis, the corresponding formalization code, and written versions of two talks about this to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/marcusrossel/bachelors-thesis).
